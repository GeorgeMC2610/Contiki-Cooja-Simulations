# Contiki-Cooja Simulations

This repository contains several assignments associated with a lecture called "Αdvanced Νetwork and Μobile Ψommunications Μanagement Τopics".

**Contiki** is the operating system (an older version of Ubuntu) required to be running in a virtual machine. **Cooja** is the built-in *simulator* installed in Contiki, in which the assignments took place. Most the exercises required the students to modify several scripts written in C or analyze the behavior of several nodes or motes inside the Cooja environment. **These four exercises count for 40% of the final grade** and the rest is covered by the authorship of an article.

For the final grade, all students have to read one article and analyze it (basically re-write it in Greek) in 3000 words. In April, a list of articles were released out of which the students had to pick one to analyze. The main topic of all articles is 5G communications, and how it can be useful to humans' everyday lives.
